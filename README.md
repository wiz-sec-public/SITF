# SDLC Infrastructure Threat Framework (SITF)

A comprehensive framework for analyzing and defending against supply chain attacks targeting Software Development Lifecycle infrastructure.

## Quick Start

📖 **[Read the Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Complete methodology, case studies, and usage instructions

🔍 **[Explore Techniques Visually](app/techniques-library.html)** - Interactive visual explorer with filtering and search

� **[Launch the Flow Builder](app/)** - Interactive tool for mapping attack flows

📚 **[Browse the Technique Library](TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY.md)** - 63 documented attack techniques with risks and controls

## What is SITF?

SITF helps security teams analyze supply chain attacks by:
- Visualizing attack stages across SDLC components (Endpoint, VCS, CI/CD, Registry, Production)
- Identifying the risks that enabled each attack technique
- Mapping risks to appropriate security controls
- Understanding attack paths and lateral movement patterns

## Framework Components

- **5 Infrastructure Components**: Endpoint/IDE, VCS, CI/CD, Registry, Production/Cloud
- **63 Attack Techniques**: Pre-mapped with enabling risks and preventive controls
- **Interactive Visualizer**: Drag-and-drop interface for building attack flow diagrams
- **Real-World Case Studies**: CircleCI breach, Shai-Hulud-2, Codecov

## Documentation

- [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Start here for complete framework overview
- [TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY.md](TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY.md) - Reference catalog of all techniques
- [techniques.json](techniques.json) - Machine-readable source of truth for all techniques
- [app/README.md](app/README.md) - Visualizer setup and usage

## Contributing

To add or modify techniques:

1. Edit [`techniques.json`](techniques.json) - the source of truth
2. Run `python3 app/build-techniques.py` to regenerate documentation and web app
3. Commit all changes (JSON, Markdown, and HTML)

The build script generates:
- `TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY.md` - Human-readable documentation
- `app/techniques-library.html` - Visual technique explorer with filtering and search
- `app/index.html` - Interactive attack flow builder

**Target Audience**: Incident Response Teams, Security Architects, Threat Intelligence Teams, Security Engineers

**Focus**: Protecting producer organizations (software vendors, OSS maintainers) who create supply chain components
